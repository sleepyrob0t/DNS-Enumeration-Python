# DNS-Enumeration-Python

This is a DNS enumeration tool I built in Python in which a user enter a domain and the program will extract DNS information of the specified such as nameservers, IP addresses, email services and more. Made using the dnspython library. 

# Libraries used
- dnspython

# Future plans for improvement 
I have some ideas on how to improve the effeciency and expand the features of the software:
- Allow for user to enter and query multiple domains 
- add more DNS record types (as of right now there are six which the program returns)
- add a Graphical user interface (make the output more readable)
